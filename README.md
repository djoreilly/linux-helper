# Linux troubleshooting assistant

AI-driven agent for troubleshooting Linux problems. Built on the [Google ADK framework](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) as a [Multi-Agent System](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/).
The project structure follows the [Python Sample Agents](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents).

## Installation
This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management which can usually be installed with your package manager.
```
uv sync
```

## Running the agent
Note: [tools](tools) are used to get information from the system. These are read-only, but root is needed to get detailed information from [systemctl status](tools/systemd.py). Sudo will be tried.

Using ADK CLI:
```
export GEMINI_API_KEY=
uv run adk run linux_agent
```

Using the ADK Dev UI:
```
export GEMINI_API_KEY=
uv run adk web
```
